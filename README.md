# Graduation_project_Arab_films_Recommendation_system
When I graduated from university, I made a simple website for Arabic films that works with a system that uses artificial intelligence, where this system suggests Arabic films to me after watching them according to the ratings.

The idea of ​​the project was the "Arabic Movie Recommendation System", a system similar to the systems used in Netflix and Amazon
Where the user is suggested to watch Arab films similar to the same (actor, director, film type) according to his ratings and admiration for the films he has watched before using artificial intelligence #AI
In the end, it is a simple system that can be developed for similar uses in the field of artificial intelligence.
